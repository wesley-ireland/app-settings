# App Settings
Settings for various applications that I use, have spent time to configure, and would rather not lose the configuration for :) 

## iTerm2
Drop the preferences file into your `~/Library/Preferences/` folder

## DuckDuckGo
The `ddg-settings.txt` file contains a url with all the settings in the query string. Navigating to that url should be sufficient to get DDG to pick up the settings
